**THEME: ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG) OF HEART AILMENTS**


**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) pose a major threat to global health, demanding timely diagnosis and treatment. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are crucial in assessing cardiac health, but analyzing the signals accurately remains challenging. The project aims to develop a machine learning-based system to classify various heart ailments using ECG data. By analyzing ECG signal patterns, this system can help in improving the diagnosis of different heart conditions.



**Project Overview**  

This project focuses on the comprehensive analysis of ECG data, sourced from the "ECG of Cardiac Ailments Dataset" (Kaggle). The primary goals include:

1.Investigating the distribution of ECG signals.

2.Identifying correlations between ECG features using heatmaps.

3.Classifying heart ailments by analyzing key ECG features.

4.Examining heart rate distribution across different ailments.

5.Exploring relationships between ECG feature pairs to aid disease classification.

6.Machine learning algorithms were applied to classify heart ailments, using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis to refine the results.
